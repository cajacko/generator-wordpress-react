Protect WordPress website forms from spam entries with Google reCaptcha.

== Description ==

Google Captcha (reCaptcha) plugin is an effective security solution that protects your WordPress website forms from spam entries while letting real people pass through with ease.  It can be used for login, registration, password recovery, comments, popular contact forms, and other.

Users are required to confirm that they are not a robot before the form can be submitted. It's easy for people and hard for bots.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to get Google Captcha (reCAPTCHA) keys? =

You should go to the Settings page and click the 'here' link. Then you should enter your domain name in text field and click 'Create Key' button.
On the next screen you will see your public and private keys.

= How to hide Google Captcha in Comments for registered users? =

You should go to the Settings page and select the roles, for which you want to hide Google Captcha.
Then you must click 'Save Changes' button.

= How to change Google Captcha (reCAPTCHA) style? =

You should go to the Settings page and select Theme from dropdown list.
Then you must click the 'Save Changes' button.

= How can I change the location of Google Captcha (reCAPTCHA) in the comments form? =

It depends on the comments form. If the hook call by means of which captcha works ('after_comment_field' or something like this) is present in the file comments.php, you can change captcha positioning by moving this hook call. Please find the file 'comments.php' in the theme and change position of the line

`do_action( 'comment_form_after_fields' );`

or any similar line - place it under the Submit button.

In case there is no such hook in the comments file of your theme, then, unfortunately, this option is not available.

= I would like to add Google Captcha (reCAPTCHA) to the custom form on my website. How can I do this? =

1. Install the Google Captcha (reCAPTCHA) plugin and activate it.
2. Open the file with the form (where you would like to add Google Captcha (reCAPTCHA) to).
3. Find a place to insert the code for the Google Captcha (reCAPTCHA) output.
4. Insert the necessary lines:

`if( function_exists( 'gglcptch_display' ) ) { echo gglcptch_display(); };`

If the form is HTML you should insert the line with the PHP tags:

`<?php if( function_exists( 'gglcptch_display' ) ) { echo gglcptch_display(); }; ?>`
